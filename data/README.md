# Data Directory Overview

This directory contains all data files for the AI Search Arena News Citation Analysis project, organized into three main categories: raw datasets, intermediate processing results, and final analysis outputs.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
data/
├── raw_data/           # Original datasets (require download)
├── intermediate/       # Processed data from pipelines (not committed to the repo)
└── output/            # Final analysis results and publications
```

## 🗂️ Raw Data (`raw_data/`)

**Purpose**: Contains original, unprocessed datasets that serve as inputs to the analysis pipelines.

**Important**: Some raw data files are **not included in the repository** due to size constraints and must be downloaded separately.

## 🔄 Intermediate Data (`intermediate/`)

**Purpose**: Contains processed data tables generated by the analysis pipelines. These files are created automatically when running the workflows.

## 📊 Output Data (`output/`)

**Purpose**: Contains final analysis results, publication-ready tables, figures, and comprehensive reports.
